                        <h1>Mona Lisa</h1>
                        <p>Five centuries after Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa (1503‚Äì19), the portrait
                            hangs
                            behind
                            bulletproof glass within the Louvre Museum and draws thousands of jostling spectators
                            each
                            day.
                            It is the most famous painting in the world, and yet, when viewers manage to see the
                            artwork
                            up
                            close, they are likely to be baffled by the small subdued portrait of an ordinary woman.
                            She‚Äôs
                            dressed modestly in a translucent veil, dark robes, and no jewelry. Much has been said
                            about
                            her
                            smile and gaze, but viewers still might wonder what all the fuss is about. Along with
                            the
                            mysteries of the sitter‚Äôs identity and her enigmatic look, the reason for the work‚Äôs
                            popularity
                            is one of its many conundrums. Although many theories have attempted to pinpoint one
                            reason
                            for
                            the art piece‚Äôs celebrity, the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one
                            explanation.</p>

                        <h1>Creation of Adam</h1>
                        <p>Michelangelo was inspired by the Genesis phrase "God created man in his own image" by
                            drawing
                            two
                            similar bodies, both strong and robust.

                            On the left side is Adam lying on the ground, and seems to be waking up, while God on
                            the
                            right
                            side comes from Heaven surrounded by angels.

                            The look of the Creator, represented with a long beard and gray hair, is determined
                            while
                            the
                            look of Adam represented with a strong young man, seems to be one of naive amazement.

                            Just below Adam is one of the Ignudi, while the background of the scene does not contain
                            much
                            details and the light background further highlights the characters and the scene turns
                            into
                            a
                            clear iconic message.

                            The main detail of the fresco is surely represented bythe fingers of God and Adam
                            touching
                            each
                            other. </p>

                        <h1>Wheatfield with crows</h1>
                        <p>Wheatfield with Crows is one of Van Gogh's most famous paintings. It is often claimed
                            that
                            this
                            was his very last work. The menacing sky, the crows and the dead-end path are said to
                            refer
                            to
                            the end of his life approaching. But that is just a persistent myth. In fact, he made
                            several
                            other works after this one.

                            Van Gogh did want his wheatfields under stormy skies to express 'sadness, extreme
                            loneliness',
                            but at the same time he wanted to show what he considered 'healthy and fortifying about
                            the
                            countryside'.

                            Van Gogh used powerful colour combinations in this painting: the blue sky contrasts with
                            the
                            yellow-orange wheat, while the red of the path is intensified by the green bands of
                            grass.

                        <h1>The Scream</h1>
                        <p>The Scream is a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893. The
                            agonized
                            face
                            in the painting has become one of the most iconic images of art, seen as symbolizing the
                            anxiety
                            of the human condition. Munch's work, including The Scream, would go on to have a
                            formative
                            influence on the Expressionist movement.[1]

                            Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sun's
                            light
                            turned the clouds "a blood red". He sensed an "infinite scream passing through nature".
                            Scholars
                            have located the spot to a fjord overlooking Oslo[2] and have suggested other
                            explanations
                            for
                            the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a
                            psychological
                            reaction by Munch to his sister's commitment at a nearby lunatic</p>

                    Where I did my first internship.
                    I have worked on frontend and backend at sarjagi.com, which is a new startup. I had the
                    opportunity
                    to practice interface design, responsive design and nodejs. <br>

                    I did an internship at istecenter, which focuses on cyber security. The subject of the project we
                    worked on was to code a python script that tests security vulnerabilities on iot devices. I had the
                    opportunity to work as a group. <br>
